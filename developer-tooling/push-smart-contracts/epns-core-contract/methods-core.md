### Getter Functions

**13. getChannelState(address)**

```
function getChannelState(address _channel) external view returns(uint256 state) {};
```

|     Argument    |    Type   |                   Description                  |
| :-------------: | :-------: | :--------------------------------------------: |
| _**\_channel**_ | _address_ | address of the channel whose state is required |

_**Description:**_

* Returns the current state of the Channel.

**14. getChannelVerification(address)**

```
function getChannelVerfication(address _channel) public view returns (uint8 verificationStatus) {};
```

|     Argument    |    Type   |                       Description                       |
| :-------------: | :-------: | :-----------------------------------------------------: |
| _**\_channel**_ | _address_ | address of the channel whose verification tag is needed |

_**Description:**_

* Returns the verification tag of the channel's address passed in the argument.
* If the target channel is currently not verified by anyone, the function returns **0**.
* If the target channel was verified by the Push Channel admin itself, the function returns **1**. It means the channel has a **Primary verification tag**.
* If the target channel was verified by any other verified channel, the function returns **2**. It means the channel has a **Secondary verification tag**. _Note: It's quite important to keep the following Channel Verification procedure of Push Core in mind:_
* _If a Channel (C-A) with **Secondary verification tag** verifies other channels in the protocol but **later gets unverified by the Push Channel Admin**, all the other channels that were verified by that specific channel **'C-A**' get unverified as well._ For instance,

> 1. Push Channel Admin verifies Channel A - Primary Verification
> 2. Channel A verifies Channel B, C & D - Secondary Verification
> 3. Push channel admin revokes the verification of Channel A
> 4. Channel B, C, & D are unverfied as well
