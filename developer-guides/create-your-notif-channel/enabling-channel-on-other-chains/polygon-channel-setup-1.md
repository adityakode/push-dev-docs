# Binance Smart Chain (Channel Setup)

## Setting Up Channel Alias for Binance Smart Chain

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important Note:** This part of the guide assumes that you have successfully created a channel and passed the correct BSC address as the alias address during the channel creation process.

If you haven't set up your channel yet, please read the [..](../ "mention") section and create your channel with the correct alias address.
{% endhint %}

Now that you have the channel created successfully on the Ethereum chain, and you have passed your preferred alias address for BSC, let's quickly understand how you can verify your alias address.&#x20;

### Channel Verification on Alias Network

In order to ensure that the alias address provided (_during channel creation_) actually belongs to the owner of the channel, alias verification is included as a part of the channel creation procedure.

Additionally, a channel owner can only use his alias address to communicate with its BSC subscribers after the alias verification is successfully executed on the Binance chain itself.

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Make sure you have already added the Binance Smart Chain network to your MetaMask._&#x20;

_In case you havenâ€™t, check out_ [_this guide_](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain)_, on how to do it._
{% endhint %}

## Step-by-Step Guide to Alias Verification

Verification of alias address must happen on the selected chain (_in this case, Binance Smart Chain_) itself.&#x20;

Once you initiate the channel creation procedure for your channel on Ethereum with the right BSC alias address, you will arrive at the page as can be seen below.

As can be seen below the Channel's name, the **Alias Network Setup is Pending.**&#x20;

It means, although you have provided the Binance alias address, you haven't verified the same on the Binance chain.

Therefore, as a part of the verification procedure, you need to switch your network to Binance Smart Chain first.

Once you have switched your network to Binance Smart Chain, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Log into the Dapp with the same address provided as the **Alias Address** during channel creation.
2.  Go to the **Create Channel** menu in the sidebar. As your channel is not yet verified on Binance Smart Chain, you might see a page like the one attached below ðŸ‘‡.

3. Click the **Verify Alias Address** button.
4. Approve the transaction required for Alias Verification, on the Binance Smart Chain.

That's it.&#x20;

Once the transaction is approved, your alias address is verified on Binance Smart Chain and is now successfully set up and linked with your channel on the Ethereum chain.&#x20;

You shall now be able to access your channel profile page and be able to send notifications from BSC using your alias address to notify your users on Binance smart chain
